Downloads
=========
The [release page](https://github.com/Wsheerio/webmConverter/releases) should have a build of the most recent version.

You're going to need [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/), I recommend grabbing one of the static builds.

Place WebM Converter.exe and the fonts folder in the same directory as ffmpeg.exe

You also need [.NET Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851)
