Downloads
=========
[This](https://github.com/Wsheerio/webmConverter/raw/master/Executable/webmConverter.zip) should be a build of the most recent version.

You're going to need [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/), I recommend grabbing one of the static builds.

Place WebMConverter.exe and the fonts folder in the same directory as ffmpeg.exe

You also need .NET Framework 4.0
